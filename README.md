# NetFlix-Clone
I'm building a Netflix clone using HTML and CSS initially, aiming to replicate its design and layout. As time progresses, I plan to enhance its responsiveness using JavaScript and React.js, ensuring smooth functionality across various devices. This project enables me to hone my front-end development skills while creating an immersive streaming experience similar to Netflix.
